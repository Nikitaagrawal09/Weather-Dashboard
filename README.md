# 🌦️ Weather Forecast Dashboard – Power BI

This project is a weather monitoring dashboard built in Power BI, leveraging API data to provide real-time and forecast-based insights across multiple Indian cities.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Consumes data from a public weather API for current and 7-day forecast information
- Covers 7 Indian cities with dynamically updated visuals
- Interactive design with filterable elements, including:
  - Forecast metrics (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind)
  - Time-based segments (morning, afternoon, evening)
  - Sunrise & sunset cards
  - Toggle feature to switch between metrics using parameters

## 📊 Features

- **API Integration**: JSON data pulled from a weather API, parsed and transformed using Power Query
- **Dynamic Visuals**: Charts and cards update based on selected city and day
- **User Interactivity**: Toggle functionality with field parameters for multiple forecast views
- **Error Handling**: Cleaned missing values (e.g., “No moonrise” entries) using conditional logic
- **Design Elements**: Custom icons, formatted time visuals, conditional formatting

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Power BI (DAX, Power Query M)
- Weather API (JSON format)
- Custom visuals and formatting

## 📌 Learning Outcomes

- Parsing and flattening JSON from APIs in Power BI
- Working with nested fields and inconsistencies in real-world datasets
